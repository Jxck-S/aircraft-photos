# aircraft-photos

Database of my aircraft photos for the plane-notify bot, replacing planespotters.net photos (they would not approve mine). These images can also be reused in other places like tar1090 overlays or map popups.

## Live Gallery

Browse the photos here:

https://jxck-s.github.io/aircraft-photos/web/

The gallery lists tail numbers with photographer credit and offers a lightbox view.

## Usage

Photos are organized by tail number in `images/` with metadata in `photo-list.json`. If you reuse them, please keep the photographer credit where possible.

## Contributing

Submit a PR adding a new image file under `images/` and an entry to `photo-list.json` including photographer attribution.

## License / Credits

All photos © their respective photographers. Gallery code © 2025.
